## What is nest?

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable **Node.js** server-side applications. It uses progressive **JavaScript**, is built with and fully supports **TypeScript** (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of **OOP (Object Oriented Programming)**, **FP (Functional Programming)**, and **FRP (Functional Reactive Programming)**.

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like **Express** (the default) and optionally can be configured to use **Fastify** as well!

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.
